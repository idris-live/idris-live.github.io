# idris.Live

**_Work in progress! Not yet useful._**

This site supplements the official [Idris Tutorial](http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/tutorial/)
to provide a gentler introduction for programmers who don't already
have a background in dependently typed languages, and/or who don't know Haskell.

If this material proves useful, perhaps it will be cherry-picked back into the
official tutorial or become a stand-alone tutorial of its own. For now, please
consider this a rapid prototype. Also, please be aware that the primary
author of this material is not associated with the Idris
project and has not yet written much Idris code. This is a learning
experience for all of us.

This site is maintained [on GitHub](https://github.com/idris-live/idris-live.github.io).
Comments and PRs are invited.
