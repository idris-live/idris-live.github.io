# Will I Like Idris?

__Work in progress!__ So far, I have only captured a few high-level thoughts.

Idris is a beautiful language. That's a matter of taste, of course. But if you appreciate elegant,
expressive code, you may find it in Idris. I do.

You are very likely here because you heard that dependent types are cool. You may even have heard
that Idris is the only [Pac-Man-complete](https://twitter.com/edwinbrady/status/384671269490540544)
language with dependent types. Dependent types are a great reason to visit Idris. For some who
enjoy charging out into the new programming frontier of dependent types, they may be a good enough
reason to stay.

But it is too early to say whether dependent types in their full glory are a good idea.
[Some argue](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/3zc81v/tradeoffs_of_dependent_types_xpost_from_ridris/?st=it7n481k&sh=4a2108bf)
that, at least as currently understood and implemented, dependent types are a morass of complexity and demand
a mathematical sophistication that few programmers have. Certainly, at best, they dependent types
[are a novel technique](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/idris-lang/7GmLjNKRuQ4)
with relatively little introductory material, few good examples, and immature tool chains.

For now, I prefer to think of dependent types as a clean, consistent type system that builds on
one cohesive paradigm to provide great expressive power. Over time, we as a community will learn
what is productive to express in the type system and what is counter-productive. We will learn a lot
by pushing the frontier of dependent types. For practical programming in Idris, we should drive
toward expressiveness while deeply respecting the value of simplicity.

The next section will help you with [Understanding Dependent Types](/understanding_dependent_types).
