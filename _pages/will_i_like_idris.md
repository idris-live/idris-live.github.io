# Will I Like Idris?

__Work in progress!__ So far, I have only captured a few high-level thoughts.

Idris is a beautiful language. That's a matter of taste, of course. But if you appreciate elegant,
expressive code, you may find it in Idris. I do.

Most likely, you are here because you heard that dependent types are cool. You may even have heard
that Idris is the only [Pac-Man-complete](https://twitter.com/edwinbrady/status/384671269490540544)
language with dependent types. Dependent types are a great reason to visit Idris. If you are
enthusiastic about exploring the new programming frontier of dependent types, they may be a good enough
reason for you to stay.

But it is too early to say whether dependent types in their full glory are a good idea.
[Some argue](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/3zc81v/tradeoffs_of_dependent_types_xpost_from_ridris/?st=it7n481k&sh=4a2108bf)
that, at least as currently understood and implemented, dependent types are a morass of complexity and demand
a mathematical sophistication that few programmers have. At best, dependent types
[are a novel technique](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/idris-lang/7GmLjNKRuQ4)
with relatively little introductory material, few good examples, and immature tool chains. Dependent types
allow us to go very far toward writing code that contains its own proof of correctness. Perhaps for some
applications, such as life-critical systems, we will find that this is worthwhile. But here be complexity
dragons.

For now, I prefer to think of dependent types as a clean, consistent type system that builds on
one cohesive paradigm to provide great expressive power. Over time, we as a community will learn
the best use of this power. We will learn a lot by pushing out toward the frontier. Personally,
I am more interested in the possibility that dependent types can make our code more expressive
and more trustworthy, yet still simple.

The next section will help you with [Understanding Dependent Types](/understanding_dependent_types).
