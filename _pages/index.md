# idris.live

_Updated September 18, 2016_

This site supplements the official [Idris Tutorial](http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/tutorial/)
to provide a gentler introduction for programmers who don't already
have a background in dependently typed languages, and/or who don't know Haskell.

__Work in progress! Not yet reviewed.__\\
For now, please consider this a rapid prototype. Also, please be aware that
the primary author of this material is not associated with the Idris
project and has not yet written much Idris code. This is a learning
experience for all of us. For an authoritative, yet still drafty, introduction to
Idris, see the work-in-progress book by its creator:
[Type-Driven Development with Idris](https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris)
{: .notice--warning}

## Table of Contents

| Section | When to Read It | Intended Audience |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| [Will I like Idris?](/will_i_like_idris)| before the official tutorial | everyone new to Idris |
| [Understanding Dependent Types](/understanding_dependent_types)| for a taste of dependent types, or if they get confusing | everyone new to dependent types |

## Coming Soon

| The Role of Proofs| before reading *Example: The Well-Typed Interpreter* in the official tutorial | everyone new to dependent types |

## How To Participate

This site is maintained [on GitHub](https://github.com/idris-live/idris-live.github.io).
Comments and PRs are invited. If this material proves useful,
perhaps it will be cherry-picked back into the official tutorial or beyond.
Dean would consider plagiarism the sincerest form of flattery.
