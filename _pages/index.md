# idris.live

**_Work in progress! Not yet useful._**

This site supplements the official [Idris Tutorial](http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/tutorial/)
to provide a gentler introduction for programmers who don't already
have a background in dependently typed languages, and/or who don't know Haskell.

## Table of Contents

| Section | When to Read It | Intended Audience |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| [Will I like Idris?](/will_i_like_idris)| before the official tutorial | everyone new to Idris |
| [Understanding Dependent Types](/understanding_dependent_types)| before the official tutorial | everyone new to dependent types |

If this material proves useful, perhaps it will be cherry-picked back into the
official tutorial or become a stand-alone tutorial of its own. For now, please
consider this a rapid prototype. Also, please be aware that the primary
author of this material is not associated with the Idris
project and has not yet written much Idris code. This is a learning
experience for all of us.

This site is maintained [on GitHub](https://github.com/idris-live/idris-live.github.io).
Comments and PRs are invited.
