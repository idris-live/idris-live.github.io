This site supplements the official [Idris Tutorial](http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/tutorial/)
to provide a gentler introduction for programmers who don't already
have a background in dependently typed languages, and/or who don't know Haskell.

__Work in progress! Not yet reviewed.__\\
For now, please consider this a rapid prototype. Also, please be aware that
the primary author of this material is not associated with the Idris
project and has not yet written much Idris code. This is a learning
experience for all of us.\\

For an authoritative, yet still drafty, introduction to
Idris, see the work-in-progress book by its creator:
[Type-Driven Development with Idris](https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris).

This site is maintained [on GitHub](https://github.com/idris-live/idris-live.github.io).
Comments and PRs are invited. If this material proves useful,
perhaps it will be cherry-picked back into the official tutorial or beyond.
Dean would consider plagiarism the sincerest form of flattery.
